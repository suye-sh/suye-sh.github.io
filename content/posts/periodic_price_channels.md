The price channel is a common pattern used by traders to find sniper entries and exits in trending markets. The biggest moves with these channels comes at breakouts at the channel lines by using the momentum of stop losses and market order executions. Smart traders who catch these breakouts are able to secure quick anc concise trades that maximize their profits. As I was doing some technical analysis for Ethereum, I noticed an additional layer of patterns that formed by drawing out multiple price channels equidistant from each other in bullish and bearish directions, and is something I call periodic price channels. These can be seen from small to large timeframes across many different markets, but I will focus on Ethereum here.

Here, we can see the pattern being formed on the weekly time frame:

The lower highs formed following the breakouts could be used as perfect short entries in a swing trading strategy. My theory is that the reason the breakouts from the channels incur such a precise and symmetric push into the new channel is due to the proportionate volume of stop losses accumulated during the consolidation within the channel. Then, the price simply moves in a periodic fashion perhaps due to the psychology of smart traders or market structure as defined by liquidity available at the new lower high. 

Now, I will explore an example which can be used in a scalping strategy:

Here we can see that the same pattern occurs, but on a much smaller time frame. Similarly, the breakouts from the channels allow for bigger moves due to added momentum from stop losses and market order executions. The price follows the periodic nature of these blue channels within the larger red channel. While the red channel implies overall bearish market structure, the blue channels can be used to identify how the price is consolidating and pulling back within the red channel to find entries for potential shorts.

Here is a deeper look into one of the blue channels:

Here, we can see that these groups of channels form on even smaller time frames, allowing for some great scalping on exchanges with smaller spreads. I believe the same principles apply for the reasoning the price follows such a recurring pattern, but I believe reason is more due to stop losses being hit than other price action indicators.

Many strategies across a variety of time frames could be built using this strategy without the additional help of other indicators. I have yet to see any other information about these equidistant recurring price channels that form, but I believe that there is more to explore about this particular price action pattern that has not been discovered yet.
